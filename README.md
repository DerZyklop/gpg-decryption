# gpg decryption without gpg for Mail.app

OSX Yosemite broke the gpg integration in OSX's Mail.app. Since then, i needed to decrypt emails per command line. To make this easier, i created this little Project.

# How to use it

Download [this project](https://github.com/DerZyklop/gpg-decryption/archive/master.zip). Copy your `encrypted.asc` file from your email client into the `files` folder. 
Then double-click the file `gpg_decrypt.command`.

Open the generated file `files/encrypted.asc.eml` in your email client.
